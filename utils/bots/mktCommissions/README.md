## Marketing Commissions

### Purpose
The marketing commission system gets an update. 
With the new system we're no longer denpending to 3rd-party-bots and it's easier and clearer to use it.

### Usage

``request``: Use that command in [#ðŸ¤–â”ƒcommands ](799855856295608345) to create a commission request.

``mktadd``: If you're an authorized person (Secret Service, Executive Assistant, Director, Manager, Assistant Manager),
you can use that command in a commission channel to add users to the channel who don't have access to it.
